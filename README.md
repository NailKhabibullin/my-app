# The application is developed to address the following customer requirements:

1. Initialize a new Create React App project using the TypeScript template.
2. Install development libraries: react-router-dom, react-bootstrap, bootstrap.
3. Connect Bootstrap styles to the project.
4. Implement a navigation menu using react-router-dom (3-4 pages).
5. Add content to the pages.
6. Utilize components from the react-bootstrap library during development.
7. Implement handling of a 404 error (redirect to the main page).
8. Install the axios library.
9. Use axios to fetch data from the server.
10. Display a list of records on the page.
11. Add a form for creating an object and implement data submission to the server.


## To run the project after downloading it from a remote repository, you need to follow these steps:

Install the necessary dependencies: In the project's root directory, run the command `npm install` in the command line to install all the project dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

Start the project: After successfully installing the dependencies, run the command `npm start` in the command line. This will start the development server and open your project in the browser at http://localhost:3000 (unless the port has been changed).

Verify the project's functionality: After the project starts, you should see it in your browser. Make sure that the project is working correctly and displaying the expected pages and functionality.

It's important to note that for successful project execution after downloading it from a remote repository, you will also need the necessary development tools such as Node.js and a package manager (usually npm). Ensure that these tools are installed and properly configured on your computer.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
